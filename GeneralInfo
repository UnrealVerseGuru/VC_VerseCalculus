1. VC - Verse Calculus created for  precise expression of functional logic programming as a term-rewriting system, to give us both a formal semantics (via small-step reductions), and a powerful set of equivalences that programmers can use to reason about their programs, and that compilers can use to optimize them. So with VC goal was to make it defined in terms of intended mechanisms of the language in respects the conceptual structures of the Verse language.
Essentialy low level step by step structured approach for distilling the essence of functional logic programming.
Written in light of practical application for Verse programming language (but with few acknowledgements can be applied to functional logic programming languages as it steems from concepts arousing and generally applied for them).
